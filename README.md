# fishing_site
- Start on the Internet:
In order for the phishing site to work, you need to download the zip archive from github. Next, you need to publish it on any paid / free hosting server (just look at the guides on the Internet).

- Run on your computer:
To do this, you need to download the "Open Server" program. Move and unzip the archive downloaded from the github along the path ..\OpenServer\domains\ then rename the unpacked folder as we want. In the tray, launch the program. In the browser we write: "http://foldername/". All the site functions perfectly on your computer.
