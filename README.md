!!! THE USE OF PHISHING FOR EVIL IS PUNISHED BY THE LAW!!!

- Start on the Internet:
In order for the phishing site to work, you need to download the zip archive from github. Next, you need to publish it on any paid / free hosting server (just look at the guides on the Internet).

- Run on your computer:
To do this, you need to download the "Open Server" program. Move and unzip the archive downloaded from github along the path ..\OpenServer\domains\ then rename the unpacked folder as we want. In the tray, launch the program. In the browser we write: "http://foldername/". All the site functions perfectly on your computer.

- How does a phishing site work? To begin with, the design of the entrance to the social network is copied. After that, in one of the many programming languages, a code is created that intercepts data from the form (fields where you enter your login or password). The intercepted data can be sent in different ways (usually they are written in the .txt format on the hosting), but as a result, the scammer gets your username and password.

- What can a scammer do when he gets access to your account? The simplest and most harmless thing he can do is to send a phishing link to other people on your behalf. In the worst case, he can blackmail you with your personal photos, data, correspondence (if any).

- The difference between phishing links and regular ones:
1) URL. For example, the original site has a link https://vk.com/, and the scammer has https://vk.ru/ or http://vlk.com/.
2) Design. Some phishing links may have a different design. For example, Instagram may have an old design.

- How to protect yourself from phishing links? First of all, vigilance is important, but if you are not given to be careful, then you should set up two-step verification.
